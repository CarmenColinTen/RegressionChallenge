# RegressionChallenge
The challenge consists in dealing with a regression problem using a parametric and a nonparametric approach.
In particular,  the former will consist in estimating a linear regression model for the train data contained in the train_ch.csv. 
The latter will consist in using KNN to predict the response values for the test observations
Your task is to use the  training data to build your models and to test them on the test_ch.csv observations.
